Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) Traffic Management (UTM) project
============================================================
UTM systems are of great interest both for the industry and for government agencies. However, safety and liveness guarantees cannot be tractably made for multi-vehicle systems. In order to combat the curse of dimensionality, this project demonstrates the following:

1. how reachability analysis can be used to guarantee pair-wise collision avoidance and single-vehicle liveness
2. how imposing the structure of platooning can help maintain the above guarantees for a large number of vehicles
3. how platoons of UAVs may behave and how they may be implemented
4. how cost-minimizing air highways may be placed
