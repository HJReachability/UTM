\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
We considered single-file platoons of UAVs modeled by hybrid systems traveling along air highways. Using HJ reachability, we proposed liveness controllers for merging onto highways and merging into existing platoons, and wrapped a safety controller around liveness controllers to ensure no collision between the UAVs can occur. Under the assumption that faulty vehicles can descend after a pre-specified duration, our safety controller guarantees that no collisions will occur in a single altitude level as long as at most one safety breach occurs for each vehicle in the platoon. Additional safety breaches can be handled by multiple altitude ranges in the airspace. Our simulations show that by putting vehicles into single-file platoons, the likelihood of having multiple safety breaches is low, and conflicts involving a single malfunctioning UAV or intruder can be resolved in a single altitude level.

Immediate future work includes exploring different vehicle models, investigating algorithms for resolving multiple safety breaches within the same altitude, and more broadly related problems such as airspace structure and air highway placement.
