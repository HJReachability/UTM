ACAS X Notes:
===== 10 Optimized Airborne Collision Avoidance =====
- Collision-avoidance without excessive alerting is challenging due to sensor error and uncertainty in future paths
- POMDP and DP
- statistical airspace model represented as dynamic Bayesian network learned from recorded data

=== 10.1 Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems (Page 1) ===
- 1956 collision prompted establishment of FAA --> redesigned airspace and used ground-based radars
- 2 more collisions in 1978 and 1986 prompted an additional layer of protection in the form of an onboard system.

--- 10.1.1 Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (Page 2) ---
- Beacon Collision Avoidance System (BCAS): designed for low desntiy space, used radio channel to estimate distance and share data

- Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS): enhanced BCAS to use in high-density airspace
-- conducts airborne surveillance, computes advisories using safety logic, and relays advisories through audio and display
-- traffic advisory (TA) -> potential threat
-- resolution advisory (RA) -> necessary avoidance maneuver
-- ONLY offers vertical guidance
-- declares "Clear of Conflict" after resolution
-- uses straight-line extrapolation --> open-loop control; many heuristic rules to compensate sensor noise and error + pilot variability

--- 10.1.2 Limitations of Existing System (Page 3) ---
- fundamental limitation: deterministic model, does not recognize noncompliance of aircrfats
- cannot keep up with evolving, denser airspace --> too many alerts
- only used on large aircrafts due to hardware and power requirements; cannot be adapted to smaller aircrafts

--- 10.1.3 Unmanned Aircraft Sense and Avoid (Page 4) ---
- currently UAs cannot fly in civil airspace without special authorization
- TCAS not applicable because of limited climb rates --> better to do horizontal avoidance

--- 10.1.4 Airborn Collision Avoidance System X (Page 5) ---
- formulated as POMDP using DP to optimize collision avoidance system
- simulations with radar data confirmed improved safety and performance
- move from beacon-only surveillance to plug-and-play architecture that supports GPS data and new sensor modalities
- numerical table replaces logic statements

=== 10.2 Collision Avoidance Problem Formulation (Page 5) ===
- POMDP

--- 10.2.1 Resolution advisories (Page 5) ---
- same advisories as TCAS except there's only a single "maintain" action
- preventive vs. corrective advisories 
- see table for list of actions

--- 10.2.2 Dynamic Model (Page 6) ---
- simple 6-state model
-- relative altitude, verticle rate of own aircraft, verticle rate of intruder, time to potential collision, current advisory, responsiveness of pilot
-- sampling time is 1 second
- always responds to COC, continue to respond to the same advisory, response delay of initial advisory is 5s, for reversals is 5s, and for strengthening/weakening is 3.
- dynamics are in equation 10.2 (page 8)

--- 10.2.3 Reward Function (page 8) --- 
- event rewards in table 10.2

--- 10.2.4 Dynamic Programming (Page 10) ---
- assumes full observability
- uses sigma-point sampling to evaluate integral for expected value
- local approximation value iteration algorithm computes value
- 33x25x25x40x16x2 grid
- single sweep of Gauss-Seidel value iteration is required (wait, how?)

=== 10.3 State Estimation (Page 11) ===
- system estimates a believe distribution of states in real time
- Q value function computed offline, accessed online to derive control; interpolation is used for states in between discrete states
- belief function factored into 3 independent components: relative altitude and climb rates, time to collision, and discrete states

--- 10.3.1 Sensor Error (Page 11) ---
- altitude measurement is quantized and has error
- TCAS uses filters to estimate vertical rates
- ACAS X uses Kalman-based filter to better accommdate quantization error and outputs weighted state samples

--- 10.3.2 Pilot Response (Page 12) ---
- pdated over time according to Bayes' rule

--- 10.3.3 Time to Potential Collision (Page 12) ---
- white-noise acceleration vectors used for estimation of time to collision
- compute P(other aircraft comes within danger zone within k seconds) by backwards propagation from k=0.
- horizontal position distribution inferred from sensor measurements
