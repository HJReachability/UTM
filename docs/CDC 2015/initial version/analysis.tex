Safety: 
\begin{itemize}
\item There always exists a safety control to keep the system safe for a prescribed time horizon despite the worst case disturbances 
\item Pairwise safety is translated into safety among all vehicles in the platoon \textcolor{blue}{thanks to linear chain and platoon assumptions. (Main proposition?)}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Safety with respect to intruder vehicles: under what exact conditions? What can we prove?}
\end{itemize}
