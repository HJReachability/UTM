% function addVehicle(obj, nextID, reachInfo)

% Adds a vehicle to the back of the platoon. A new vehicle will be created!
% (as opposed to assimVehicle(), careful!)
%
% This function is mainly for conveniently initializing a platoon. Also see

% Inputs: obj       - platoon object
%         reachInfo - reachability information to put into the vehicle
%                     being added
%         nextID    - the ID of the new vehicle being added
