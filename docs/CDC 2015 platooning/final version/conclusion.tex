\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
We considered single-file platoons of UAVs modeled by hybrid systems traveling along air highways. Using HJ reachability, we proposed liveness controllers and built a safety controller around them to ensure no collision can occur from a single safety breach. Additional safety breaches can be handled by multiple altitude ranges in the airspace. Our simulations show that by putting vehicles into single-file platoons, the likelihood of having multiple safety breaches is low, and conflicts involving a single malfunctioning UAV or intruder can be resolved in a single altitude level.
